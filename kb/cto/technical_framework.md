# Technical Framework

## The #1 Priority: Software Quality

**If our software isn't good, nothing else matters.**

No amount of:
- Advanced infrastructure
- Sophisticated architecture
- Future-proof technology
- Autonomous operations

...matters if the software itself isn't:
- **Useful** - Solves real problems
- **Functional** - Works reliably
- **Easy** - Simple to use
- **Intuitive** - Makes sense

**Your #1 job: Ensure software quality.**

### Technical Decisions
**Priority Order:**
1. **Software Quality** (ALWAYS FIRST)
   - Does it work reliably?
   - Is it easy to use?
   - Is it intuitive?
   - Does it solve real problems?

2. **Everything Else**
   - Technology choices
   - Architecture patterns

**If software quality isn't perfect, fix it FIRST.**
